EUROPEAN PROTEIN CONSUMPTION
We consider 25 European countries (n = 25 units) and their protein 
intakes (in percent) from nine major food sources (p = 9).

Approachs to solve this problem

Kmean-clustering

1.load library and data

2.first clustering on just Red and White meat(p=2) and k=3 clusters.

3.List of cluster assignments

4.graphical Representation of the clustering solution

5.protein groups change the number of clusters to 7


Hierarchical-clustering

1.Creation of dendrogram by applying euclidean distance method.

2.Choose the number of dendrogram.

3.Visualising the clusters.
