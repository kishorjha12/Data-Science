EUROPEAN PROTEIN CONSUMPTION
We consider 25 European countries (n = 25 units) and their protein 
intakes (in percent) from nine major food sources (p = 9).

Approachs to solve this problem
Kmean-clustering
1.load library and data
2.first clustering on just Red and White meat(p=2) and k=3 clusters.
3.List of cluster assignments
4.graphical Representation of the clustering solution
5.protein groups change the number of clusters to 7

Hierarchical-clustering
1.Creation of dendrogram by applying euclidean distance method.
2.Choose the number of dendrogram.
3.Visualising the clusters.
